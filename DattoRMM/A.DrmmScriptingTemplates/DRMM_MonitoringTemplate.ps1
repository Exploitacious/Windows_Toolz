## Template for Scripting Component Monitors for Datto RMM with PowerShell
# Created by Alex Ivantsov @Exploitacious

# Script Name and Type
$ScriptName = "Check if Manufacturer is Lenovo" # Quick and easy name of Script to help identify
$ScriptType = "Monitoring" # Monitoring // Remediation

# What to Write if Alert is Healthy
$Global:AlertHealthy = " | Last Checked $Date" # Define what should be displayed in Datto when monitor is healthy and $Global:AlertMsg is blank.
# There is also another palce to put NO ALERT Healthy messages down below, to try and capture more script info.

## Verify/Elevate to Admin Session. Comment out if not needed the single line below.
# if (!([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) { Start-Process powershell.exe "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$PSCommandPath`"" -Verb RunAs; exit }

## Datto RMM Variables ## Uncomment only for testing. Otherwise, use Datto Variables. See Explanation Below.
#$env:usrUDF = 14 # Which UDF to write to. Leave blank to Skip UDF writing.
#$env:usrString = Example # Datto User Input variable "usrString"

<#
This is a Datto RMM Monitoring Script, used to deliver a result such as "Healthy" or "Not Healthy", in order to trigger the creation of tickets, etc.

To create Variables in Datto RMM Script component, you must use $env variables in the powershell script, simply by matching the name and adding "env:" before them.
For example, in Datto we can use a variable for user input called "usrUDF" and here we use "$env:usrUDF=" to use that variable.

You can use as many of these as you like.

Below you will find all the standard variables to use with Datto RMM to interract with all the the visual, alert and diagnostics cues available from the dashboards.
#># DattoRMM Alert Functions. Don't touch these unless you know what you're doing.

}
# Extra Info and Variables (Leave at default)
$Global:DiagMsg = @() # Running Diagnostic log (diaglog). Use " $Global:DiagMsg += " to append messages to this log for verboseness in the script.
$Global:AlertMsg = @() # Combined Alert message. If left blank, will not trigger Alert status. Use " $Global:AlertMsg += " to append messages to be alerted on in Datto.
$Global:varUDFString = @() # String which will be written to UDF, if UDF Number is defined by $usrUDF in Datto. Use " $Global:varUDFString += " to fill this string.
$ScriptUID = GenRANDString 20 # Generate random UID for script
$Date = get-date -Format "MM/dd/yyy hh:mm tt"
