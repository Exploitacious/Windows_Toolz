Modify these sections as needed for your environment.

# Windows Appx Bloatware Perma-Uninstall List

- See "Bloatware" Variable for full list.
- To add or remove bloatware apps from this list, simply add then in quotes with wildcard \* symbols.
- To make sure they'll be picked up and removed, test them on a machine by running: get-appxpackage -name _appName_

# Per-User first-time logon script to clean up user interface

- Make sure you download BOTH the FirstLogon.bat file and DebloatScript-HKCU.ps1 into the same directory as the main System Debloat Script.
- A copy of the Bat and HKCU will be placed in C:\Windows\FirstUserLogon and ran every time a user logs in for the FIRST TIME ONLY.
- This 'mini' script cleans up the user interface and removes some of the clutter that Windows 10 likes to throw at you.
