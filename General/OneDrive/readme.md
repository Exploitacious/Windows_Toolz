# Install OneDrive for All Users

This script downloads and silently installs the latest version of the Microsoft OneDrive client for all users on a computer.

## How to Use

1.  Save the script as a `.ps1` file (e.g., `Install-OneDrive.ps1`).
2.  Right-click the script file and select **Run with PowerShell**.
3.  The script requires administrator privileges to run. Accept the User Account Control (UAC) prompt if it appears.

## Configuration Examples

There are no variables that need to be configured in this script. It will automatically download the installer to `C:\Temp` and run it.
